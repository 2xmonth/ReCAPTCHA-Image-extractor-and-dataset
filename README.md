# ReCAPTCHA-Image-extractor-and-dataset
Simple, crappy, but semi effective

This is my Recaptcha image extractor. I made it quickly so it sucks but it gets the job done pretty quickly. Sometimes the output images are semi cut off, I dont know why it does that but i'm not fixing it.

Another dataset I recommend:
https://github.com/brian-the-dev/recaptcha-dataset


If you use ^ and mine you will have around 28k images to choose from.
